An ongoing documentation of my graduation thesis: Craft Future, an inquiry into how future can inform craft and how craft can inform futures.

## Scope
This project is an exploration on what is craft and what it means in 21st century and beyond. 
The inquiry is divided in 3 channels:
1. Process, Interventions in contemporary craft processes.
1. Framework, Analysis of how craft functions
1. Design Discource, A critical look at modern design practice

### 1.Process
The process channel would deal with experiments in technology and craft process primarily with traditional craft, a search for a hybrid between digital craft and handcrafts. Also with a critical look at artifacts would such a craft produce in future.

### 2. Framework
Framework channel would look at the power structures and craft thinking and would explore how the question of market,city,the internet and life. Can we redistribute power,control and subvert the status quo.

### 3. Design Discourse
Discourse is perhaps the most self critical channel would try to critically look at the design practice. Starting with the India Report by Charles and Ray Eames and later this project itself.
